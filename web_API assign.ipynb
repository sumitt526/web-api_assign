    "API stands for Application Programming Interface, it is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs serve as a data transmitter between two different pieces of software.\n",

    "A real-life example of an API in use is when you use a service like Uber. When you open the Uber app and log in using your Facebook or Google account, Uber is using APIs provided by Facebook and Google to access some level of your user information. This is an agreement between Uber and these companies that has already happened."

    "Improved efficiency:-> API-driven infrastructures enable developers to access the functionality of a subset of architecture in many different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility:-> APIs provide flexibility to use completely independent protocols allowing your microservices to communicate among themselves with ease.\n",

    "\n",
    "Complexity:-> APIs may lack flexibility when it comes to customization and features.APIs can be complex, requiring a significant amount of development effort to implement and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security risks:-> APIs can expose endpoints publicly, which can pose security risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of control:-> You have no ability to store data outside the API’s domain.\n",

    "Compatibility Issues:-> APIs can have compatibility issues between different versions of the same software system or between different systems, which can lead to errors and system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Governance and Management:-> APIs require proper governance and management to ensure they are being used correctly and consistently across different applications and systems."
